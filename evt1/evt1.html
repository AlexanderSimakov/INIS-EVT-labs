        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Four Jack-the-lads find themselves heavily - seriously heavily - in debt to an East End hard man and his
            enforcers after a crooked card game. Overhearing their neighbours in the next flat plotting to hold up a
            group of out-of-their-depth drug growers, our heroes decide to stitch up the robbers in turn. In a way the
            confusion really starts when a pair of antique double-barrelled shotguns go missing in a completely
            different scam.</p>

        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Turkish and his close friend/accomplice Tommy get pulled into the world of match fixing by the notorious
            Brick Top. Things get complicated when the boxer they had lined up gets badly beaten by Mickey, who comes
            into the equation after Turkish, an unlicensed boxing promoter wants to buy a caravan off of Travellers.
            They then try to convince Mickey not only to fight for them, but to lose for them too. Whilst all this is
            going on, a huge diamond heist takes place, and a fistful of motley characters enter the story, including
            'Cousin Avi', 'Boris The Blade', 'Franky Four Fingers' and 'Bullet Tooth Tony'. Things go from bad to worse
            as it all becomes about the money, the guns, and the damned dog.</p>
